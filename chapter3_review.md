## 3.4 What does it mean to preempt a process?

Moving a process from running sate to ready state is said to be preempt.This takes a resource away from a process,One such resource is the CPU.
The process involuntarily gives up the CPU.In kernel mode,a process running can be replaced by another process while in the middle of a kernel function on the premeetive kernel.
A process is "preempted" when it is scheduled out of execution and waits for the next time slice to run in.


## 3.5 What is swapping and what is its purpose?

Some blocked process moved from the main memory to the secondary memory like hard disk to increase the processors utilization using a simple memory or process management method of Operating system.
If the operating system needs data from the disk, it exchanges main memory portion of data to the disk portion of data.
And then it forms a queue of temporarily suspended process and the execution continues with the newly arrived process.The operating system has two options after swapping they are 
newly created process can be admitted by operating syaytem and can activate suspended process from the swap memory.
 
## 3.9 List three general categories of information in a process control block.

1.Process identification:Each process is assigned with a unique identifier.Other tables use process identifiers to cross reference process tables.
2.Processor state information:This includes the contents of processor registers that are user-visible registers,control and status registers,stack pointers.
3.Process control information:Additional information needed by the Operating system for controlling and coordinating various active processes.

## 3.10 Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?

Kernal mode:In Kernel mode,it has the complete executing code with unrestricted access to the hardware.Any cpu execution is done and any memory address can be referenced.It is for lowest 
level of the operating system.If any crashes occur in kernal mode the entire pc will halt.The software has complete control over all its registers,memory and instructions so safety for this
is not desired.
User Mode:In User mode, the code executing has no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory.So the code user is running must go to the systems APIs to access hardware or 
memory.If any crashes occur here,they are always recoverable because the protection is afforded by this sort of isolation and computer will execute most of the code running in user mode.
User mode is needed because it is necessary to protect the operating system and key operating system tables like process control blocks, from interference by user programs.

## 3.12 What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?

Interrupt:
An interrupt is generally generated by the hardware that are devices like the hard disk, graphics card. These are asynchronous since the interrupt handler has to wait for them to happen eventually.
They are program control interruptions caused by external hardware events that is to the cpu.Occurence of interrupts in hardware disable other hardware interrupts.
It is a signal to suspend the current execution and divert to the requested device.
Trap:
A Trap is intialized by the user that can be identified as a transfer of control. The term Trap is used interchangeably with the term Exception that is software invoked interrupts.
A trap is always unconditional the control will always be transferred to the subroutine associated with the trap.
It is an unprogrammed conditional jump to a specified address that is automatically activated by Hardware.

## 3.13 Give three examples of an interrupt?  

1.Clock interrupt:In the operating system,the currently running process has been executing for the maximum allowable time slice.
After this happens , then this process must be switched to a ready state and another process must be dispatched .
2.I/O Interrupt :What input output action has occurred is determined by the operating system .The I/P action constitutes and event for which one or more processes are waiting.
3.Memory fault:After I/O request is issued to bring in the block of memory.A process switch to resume execution of another process may be performed by the operating system. 
The processor encounters a virtual memory address reference for a word that is not in main memory then the process.

## 3.14 What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?

Mode switch:
When the cpu changes privilege levels it is refered to a mode switch. The kernel works at a higher privilege than a standard user task.It is necessary that a mode switch occurs
is for the user task to access things controlled by the kernel.During a mode switch the currently executing process does not change. 
A mode switch must occur for a software context switch and may occur without changing the state of the process that is currently in the Running state. 
Process switch:
When the processor switches from one thread/process to another it is called as an process switch. This saves the contents of the instruction pointer and cpu registers.  
The registers and instruction pointer for the new task will then be loaded into the processor and execution of the new process will start/resume. 
A process context switch involves saving more state information and then taking the currently executing process out of the Running state in favor of another process.
